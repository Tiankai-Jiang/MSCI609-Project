\section{Introduction \& objective}\label{section-introduction}
For the purpose of this project, the objective is to consider various macroeconomic factors, such as the interest rate, GDP growth rate, Consumer Confidence Index (CPI), with an effect on the country wide housing price index. We would subjectively select four individual Southeast Asian countries suitable to represent the overall four national economics level categories ranked by the World Bank. Giving the covid-19 contingency around the world, we would also like to make certain adjustment to the model used to seek a hint on the overall cross-sectional impact.

Target Countries: Japan, Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, Philippine, and Nepal (In descending order of the economics level).

\section{Proposed Model}\label{section-proposedmodel}
$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ... + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon$

Initially, we choose total population, population density, urban population percentage, unemployment rate, real estate activities, taxes on property, per capita GDP, household final consumption, interest rate as independent variables($x_i$). Dependent variable($y$) is the house price index.
