 abstract = {This paper assesses the links between money, credit, house prices, and economic activity in industrialized countries over the last three decades. The analysis is based on a fixed-effects panel vector autoregression, estimated using quarterly data for 17 industrialized countries spanning the period 1970â€”2006. The main results of the analysis are the following. (i) There is evidence of a significant multidirectional link between house prices, monetary variables, and the macroeconomy. (ii) The link between house prices and monetary variables is found to be stronger over a more recent sub-sample from 1985 to 2006. (iii) The effects of shocks to money and credit are found to be stronger when house prices are booming.},

abstract = {The paper forecasts the residential property price index in Belgium with a dynamic factor model
(DFM) estimated with a dataset of macro-economic variables describing the Belgian and euro area
economy. The model is validated with out-of-sample forecasts which are obtained recursively over
an expanding window over the period 2000q1-2012q4. We illustrate how the model reads
information from mortgage loans, interest rates, GDP and inflation to revise the residential property
price forecast as a result of a change in assumptions for the future paths of these variables.}
