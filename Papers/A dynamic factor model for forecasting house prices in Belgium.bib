abstract = {The paper forecasts the residential property price index in Belgium with a dynamic factor model
(DFM) estimated with a dataset of macro-economic variables describing the Belgian and euro area
economy. The model is validated with out-of-sample forecasts which are obtained recursively over
an expanding window over the period 2000q1-2012q4. We illustrate how the model reads
information from mortgage loans, interest rates, GDP and inflation to revise the residential property
price forecast as a result of a change in assumptions for the future paths of these variables.}
